# ‚ú® nai3_train ‚ú®

English Version: [English Documentation](./README_EN.md)

If you need to use images generated by nai3 for bulk training of your SD model, this project is for you.

nai3 generates images, and this project provides a one-click script for generating, tagging, and processing these images.

Principle 1: Randomly extract text from the `prompt_folder` directory as a prompt to generate random materials in bulk.

Turn your tagged txt into your random prompt library!

Principle 2: Randomly extract characters from json to generate random characters, or generate all characters in order.

Note: New features are welcome, and the script is continuously being optimized.

## üíø Installation and Running Environment

```bash
pip install pdm
# Automatically create a virtual environment and lock dependency versions
pdm install
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

> Use a text editor such as Notepad to open the `config.toml` file in this directory, and configure it according to the comments. The **token** is required, and the rest can be left as default.

How to get the token:

- Log in to your NovelAI account on the webpage (https://novelai.net)
- Find "Account" in the top left personal center
- Find the "Get Persistent API Token." section
- Click the "Generate Token" button to generate a token

## ü§ó Open Source Random Prompt Library

A massive txt random prompt library, just unzip and put it into `prompt_folder`.

## üéâ Quick Start

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ random_characetrs.py

Generate specified characters' images randomly or in order.

Principle: Read character names from json and generate images.

This repository includes random character libraries of several mainstream games including Genshin Impact, Arknights, FGO, etc.

Example:
Use by reading the .\json\genshin.json file to generate random Genshin Impact characters.

The structure of the json file, taking genshin.json as an example:

```
{
  "role": [
    "noelle_(genshin_impact)",
    "faruzan_(genshin_impact)",
    "Character 1",
    "Character 2",
    "Character 3",
    .....
  ]
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ random_prompt.py

Read the random prompt library and generate random nai3 images in bulk.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ nai3tagger.py

Read image information and generate a txt file with the same name.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ clear.py

Remove the prefix `prefix` from the txt file to bind the style.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ UTF-8.py

Remove illegal characters from the txt file, such as üòÑüôÉ.

Some illegal characters in the txt file may cause errors during training, and the training script cannot read the txt, so removing illegal characters is necessary.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ cut.py

Remove the watermark from the image (test feature).
